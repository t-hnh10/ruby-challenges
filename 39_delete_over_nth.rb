# Delete over nth
# In this challenge, you are given an array of numbers and a number(n)
# If a number in the array occurs more than n times, you should delete all occurrances of
# that number after the nth occurrance (without changing the order of the numbers)

# Example:
# delete_over_nth([1,1,1,2,2,2,2],2) => [1,1,2,2]
# delete_over_nth([23,30,15,23,16],1) => [23,30,15,16]

def delete_over_nth(list,n)
    # your code here
end
